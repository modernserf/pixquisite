Animated Pixel Art Exquisite Corpse

This is a spiritual fork of [draw-me](https://github.com/Will-Sommers/draw-me).

## TODOs
- design
- better shared storage
- the actual "exquisite corpse" part -- share with another user & they get your last frame(s?), at end of game play sequence of snippets
- persist whole app state in localStorage
- game progresses in time (shared frames) vs game progresses in space (shared edges) vs game progresses in evaluation (alternate drawing/interpreting)
