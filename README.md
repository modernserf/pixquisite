Animated Pixel Art Exquisite Corpse

## TODOs
- deploy to gh-pages
- drawing feels more like pencil tool (dragging)
- better color picker
- design
- use React for controls
- better shared storage
- the actual "exquisite corpse" part -- share with another user & they get your last frame, at end of game play sequence of snippets
